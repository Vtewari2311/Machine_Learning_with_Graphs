# Machine_Learning_with_Graphs
Independent Study, based on CS 224W - Machine Learning with Graphs offered by Computer Science @Stanford, Course Outcomes: Focusing on the computational, algorithmic and modeling challenges specific to analysis of massive graphs)

## Content
What is this course about?
Complex data can be represented as a graph of relationships between objects. Such networks are a fundamental tool for modeling social, technological, and biological systems. This course focuses on the computational, algorithmic, and modeling challenges specific to the analysis of massive graphs. By means of studying the underlying graph structure and its features, students are introduced to machine learning techniques and data mining tools apt to reveal insights on a variety of networks.
Topics include: 
* Representation learning and Graph Neural Networks; 
* Algorithms for the World Wide Web; 
* Reasoning over Knowledge Graphs; 
* Influence Maximization; 
* Disease Outbreak Detection, 
* Social Network Analysis.
